# Using Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) system that provides intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence. It is designed to help organizations to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. 

## Key Features of Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel provides a range of features that help to detect and respond to security threats:

1. Log Collection: Microsoft Sentinel can collect logs from a wide range of sources including cloud services, on-premises servers, and security devices. This allows organizations to centralize their security logs in a single location for easier analysis.

2. Threat Intelligence: Microsoft Sentinel uses threat intelligence to identify potential security threats. It collects information from various sources such as the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, and other security feeds.

3. Security Analytics: Microsoft Sentinel uses machine learning algorithms to analyze security logs and identify potential threats. This allows organizations to detect threats in real-time and respond quickly.

4. Automated Response: Microsoft Sentinel allows organizations to automate their response to security threats. It can perform actions such as quarantining an infected machine, blocking a suspicious IP address, or disabling a user account.

## Getting Started with Microsoft Sentinel

3. Connect Data Sources: After creating the workspace, you will need to connect your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel. This can be done using the built-in connectors or by creating custom connectors.

4. Set up Analytics Rules: Microsoft Sentinel uses analytics rules to identify potential security threats. You will need to set up these rules to start detecting threats.

5. Create Playbooks: Microsoft Sentinel allows you to create automated response actions using playbooks. You can create custom playbooks or use the built-in templates.
